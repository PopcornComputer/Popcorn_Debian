 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate
 packages.

 This package contains an informational list of packages which are

 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 counterparts.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).

Description: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: SMBIOS/DMI table decoder
 Dmidecode reports information about the system's hardware as described in the
 system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard.
 .
 This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial
 number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).

Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server
 Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP
 server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a
 small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are
 not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS
 server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses
 to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or
 in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
 DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .

 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 This package provides "less", a file pager (that is, a memory-efficient
 utility for displaying text one screenful at a time). Less has many
 more features than the basic pager "more". As part of the GNU project,
 it is widely regarded as the standard pager on UNIX-derived systems.
 .
 Also provided are "lessecho", a simple utility for ensuring arguments
 with spaces are correctly quoted; "lesskey", a tool for modifying the
 standard (vi-like) keybindings; and "lesspipe", a filter for specific
 types of input, such as .doc or .txt.gz files.

 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

Description: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and manipulation toolkit
 Services provided by Libcroco
  * A parser module that provides
    o A SAC like API. SAC stands for Simple API for CSS. SAC is an event driven
      API which resembles SAX in the xml world.
    o A CSSOM like API. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

 (Data link) into a single virtual NIC. The process is called "channel
 bonding", "Ethernet bonding", "channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.
 This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver but
 unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following
 additional features:
  * load-balancing for LACP support
  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring
  * port priorities and stickiness ("primary" option enhancement)
  * separate per-port link monitoring setup

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.28' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.28') instead.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: tool to impose load on and stress test a computer system
 'stress' is a tool that imposes a configurable amount of CPU, memory, I/O,
 or disk stress on a POSIX-compliant operating system and reports any errors
 it detects.
 .
 'stress' is not a benchmark.  It is a tool used by system administrators to
 evaluate how well their systems will scale, by kernel programmers to evaluate
 perceived performance characteristics, and by systems programmers to expose
 the classes of bugs which only or more frequently manifest themselves when
 the system is under heavy load.

 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
